# XCSensors
XCSensors is an Arduino based vario. It provides telemetry data to any vario based program such as XCSoar or XCTrack via bluetooth or wifi.

### Features:

Bluetooth, Serial or USB OTG streaming<br>
Configuration via Bluetooth, USB or Serial <br>
Dual pressure sensor support <br>
Adaptive Vario* <br>
Humidity sensor <br>
Accelerometer(under development)<br>
Piezo speaker for vario audio <br>
Serial GPS NMEA <br>

*Adaptive Vario: The sensitivity filter of the barometric sensors are adapted according to the environment. Eg. On a quiet day your flight will be more stable, causing the filter to become more sensitive to changes, this way you will be able to detect the lighter thermals.

Also if needed, switching to Bluetooth streaming is possible via a configuration option.
